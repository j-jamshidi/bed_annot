# Annotation of a bed file with gene names and exons
This repository contains a Python script that takes a bed file as input and adds gene names and exon information to the file. The script uses the Ensembl API to retrieve gene and exon information for each region in the bed file. The output is a new bed file with the gene names and exon information added.

A brief description of the project.
